# Shopping Cart

Project using Firebase, JavaScript DOM, HTML and CSS to create a list of items to buy while shopping, following along [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/firebase) tutorial 

Added my own two features: 
- A count showing users how much items have been added to the cart
- A constraint to prevent the insert/storage of an empty string in firebase database

### Adding Firebase database

Get your firebase database running, go to [firebase's site](https://firebase.google.com/), sign in and add a project. In the drop down menu, head over to Build >> Realtime database. Click on that and pick the location closest to you. Pick your security mode and start populating your database with a few items. 

### Artwork and Style

- I used coolors.co to generate [color palette](https://coolors.co/2c2871-802134-ebeaea-f9ba30-a6a4b0) from image
- Raccoon artwork created by [catalyststuff]("https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/cute-raccoon-eating-popcorn-cartoon-vector-icon-illustration-animal-food-icon-concept-isolated-flat_66605862.htm#query=racoon&position=0&from_view=author&uuid=d0cfa165-ae29-444c-b793-4e0ac8fa1554")
