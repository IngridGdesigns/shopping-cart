### Adding Firebase database

Get your firebase database running, go to [firebase's site](https://firebase.google.com/), sign in and add a project. In the drop down menu, head over to Build >> Realtime database. Click on that and pick the location closest to you. Pick your security mode and start populating your database with a few items. 

### Adding Favicon

I used [favicon](https://favicon.io/) to generate my favicon

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
